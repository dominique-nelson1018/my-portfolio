            <p>
            I am an Application Analyst for Florida Virtual School and and aspiring IOS and/or Android app developer. My biggest interest is in UX/UI design, but my skills are currently rudimentary at best.. Until I am ready to share my portfolio with future employers, I will be using it as my very own and first digital diary. Buckle up and please enjoy the ride!
